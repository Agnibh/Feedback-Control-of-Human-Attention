# Feedback-Control-of-Human-Attention

This project is a multidisciplinary initiative with an objective to develop an e-gaming
environment to increase the attention span of people with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyper-
Activity Disorder). Conventionally, medications have proved to be very effective to treat ADHD
over the short term, but researches have failed to show long-term benefits. In addition, there
are significant side effects of medication on children such as hallucinations, tics, weight loss,
depression, etc

This project aims to create a machine learning model that can give an indication of the
attentiveness of a person and use the predicted parameter to create a training environment
that changes according to the personâ€™s attention. For this, an attention aware system was
designed based on EEG signals to identify continuous attention levels of a person. Then a
machine learning model was created based on gaussian regression processes to predict realtime
attention. The final step was to simulate a game whose parameters change according to
attention levels of the player; lower attention level corresponds to more assistance and fewer
challenges compared to a period of high attention

The entire project was divided into four steps:
(i). Developing a task that gives an indication of the attention of a person through EEG
(Electroencephalogram) signals,
(ii). Processing the EEG signals to correlate with the attention of the person,
(iii). Creating a model with the data collected,
(iv). Training the person with ADHD on in e-gaming environment to improve his attention span.
